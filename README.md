# Bedlam Digital - the remote Card Game with no cards.
 
**What the ?&!@ is Bedlam?**

Bedlam is a comparison card game (in the style of Cards Against Humanity and Apples to Apples) created for people who work in or around tech.

You can buy box sets of the original core game and any of the three (as of March 2021) expansion packs at http://www.bedlamgame.com/, or you can download the cards for free. 

Or we are creating a digital version as promised to KC Lemson on a distant yammer thread, the idea is to be able to play this remotely as a team and have some fun during a virtual offsite !

**How To Play (minimum 4 players)**
1.	Join a Virtual Lobby (or start one!)
2.	System Deals each player in the lobby 7 white cards.
3.	Player that opens the lobby gets to be the judge of the first round.
4.	The lobby is dealt a black card and the Judge reads it out loud.
5.	Other players select their matched white cards from their stack.
6.	Players vote on the winning card by clicking the one that picks which of the answer cards they felt best answers the question – or not answers the question, as the case may be. Or is just randomly funny. Or, well, whatever.
7.	If it's a tie, multiple players can score a point.
8.	The player(s) who scored the most votes win the round. 
10.	The lobby runs for 10 rounds. When y’all get bored of playing, call a game over and the person with the most black cards is the winner winner chicken dinner.

P.S. pro tip: When you play Bedlam with coworkers, try not to get anyone fired! kthxbai
