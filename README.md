Bedlam the Card Game
 
What the ?&!@ is Bedlam?
Bedlam is a comparison card game (in the style of Cards Against Humanity and Apples to Apples) created for people who work in or around tech.

You can buy box sets of the core game and any of the three (as of March 2021) expansion packs at http://www.bedlamgame.com/, or you can download the cards for free. Or you can create something on top of Bedlam by cloning this repo - the world is your oyster.

How To Play (minimum 4 players)
1.	Set the black and white decks face-down on the table
2.	Deal each player 7 white cards
3.	Nominate one player to be the judge of the first round
4.	The judge draws a black card and reads it out loud
5.	Other players hand their proposed matching white card face-down to the judge
6.	The judge then reads the cards out loud
7.	The judge picks which of the answer cards they felt best answers the question – or not answers the question, as the case may be. Or is just randomly funny. Or, well, whatever.
8.	The player who submitted that winning answer gets the black card from that round
9.	The judge responsibility moves to the next person in clockwise order, and gameplay continues
10.	When y’all get bored of playing, call a game over and the person with the most black cards is the winner winner chicken dinner.

How To Play “Survival of the Fittest” style
Gameplay is the same as the above, except that when the judge reads the answer cards, starting with the person on the judge’s left, each person removes (aka votes out) a white card until there’s only one left, which is the winner.

P.S. pro tip: When you play Bedlam with coworkers, try not to get anyone fired! kthxbai
